**Nairobi, Kenya — 28 October 2025**

## Overview

Africa's Sovereign Development Trust® (ASDT) announces the **African Federation Treaty Framework (AFTF)**, to be formally unveiled at the Sandton Symposium 2025 (28 November - 3 December, Johannesburg, South Africa).

The AFTF represents the first institutional design mechanism created by Africans to mathematically resolve systemic failures perpetuating external economic dependence.

## Framework Components

The AFTF integrates:

- **African Rare Earth Mineral Fund (AREMF)** - Value retention mechanism
- **Daudi Mutuku Fund for Education (DMFE)** - STEM talent development

## Six Systemic Paradoxes Resolved

2. **Trust & Verification**: Transparency vs. Operational Security
3. **Incentive Alignment**: Unity vs. Defection
4. **Value Capture**: Avoiding Neo-Colonialism
5. **Legibility Problem**: Adapting Markets to Africa
6. **Authority Bootstrap**: From Legitimacy to Performance
