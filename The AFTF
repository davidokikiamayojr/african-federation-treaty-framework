## Background

This Framework represents three years of institutional research into African economic sovereignty, development finance architecture, and continental coordination mechanisms. It addresses the €290 billion annual cost of fragmentation (€150B security, €88.6B illicit flows, €51.4B trade barriers) by providing operational machinery rather than aspirational rhetoric.

The Framework builds on proven regional cooperation models (MNJTF, SAMIM, Kenya-Rwanda Security Pact) whilst introducing blockchain-enforced transparency, automated compliance, and measurable performance metrics absent from previous Pan-African initiatives.
